					This website was made for a prework assignment that asked us to create a basic website using HTML and CSS. The site features some of the basic CSS layout principles that we learned, including a floated image gallery and a basic three column layout. I tried to use a simple but still visually pleasing style.

					Why a website about dinosaurs? It's quite simple really. I was watching the original Jurassic Park for the hundreth time while I was starting to conceptualize the website and after getting lost in Jeff Goldblum's hazel eyes for awhile figured hey why not dinosaurs.

					This site was made for a homework assignment on the second day of class. The objective of the assignment was to build a basic website and to make git commits along the way at various points of development. The website features a clean design and makes use of floated div's and elements centered using the 'margin: 0 auto' trick.

					Why tree's and such? Sometime I get tired of all the concrete in the city and thought it would be nice to see some tree's. Also I wanted to throw a picture of my cat in there so that's where the 'such' comes in.

					This was made for a prework assignment that wanted us to focus on using floats to create various layouts. The site features an image gallery, 2 column layout, and 3 column layout.

					Lot's have people have asked me "Andy, why on earth would you make a website about toilets?". Well you see, I started the hashtag on Instagram my junior year of college as a joke with some friends and it just hasn't died off all the way yet. Also, art or something like that.
