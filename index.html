						Transforming the act of viewing and understanding government data in a new and exciting way! I taught myself the d3.js library in 2 weeks for this project!
					</p>
					<p>
						This web app uses the Mapbox API in conjunction with a customized Geojson file to capture user inputs in order to make custom calls to the CensusReporter API and NYC.gov API. It then renders those API responses using the d3.js data visualization library.

						I built everything on the front end of this wesbite. That includes but isn't limited too the D3.js, jQuery, and nearly all of the HTML/CSS/SaSS. I'm also responsible for the API and Nokogiri Gem integration

						This website was made for a prework assignment that asked us to create a basic website using HTML and CSS. The site features some of the basic CSS layout principles that we learned, including a floated image gallery and a basic three column layout. I tried to use a simple but still visually pleasing style.
					</p>
					<p>
						Why a website about dinosaurs? It's quite simple really. I was watching the original Jurassic Park for the hundreth time while I was starting to conceptualize the website and after getting lost in Jeff Goldblum's hazel eyes for awhile figured hey why not dinosaurs.

						This was a group project and also my first somewhat fleshed out website in sinatra.
					</p>
					<p>
						The site features multiple views that all work within a layout erb. I also included some jquery events to add some movement and points of interest to an otherwise static site.

						This is the first object oriented Javascript site that I made. It's a pretty straight forward webapp that lets you select and play songs from a preloaded playlist. It also gives the user the option to upload they're own songs if they'd like. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The site features a number of different options and controls, each with a corresponing function within the javasript file for increased functionality. This is also my first app that makes use of media queries and is responsive!

						My first rails app. This was a collaborative project in which we were charged with creating an app that had the same basic functionality as webapps like Twitter and Tumbler. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The site features multiple models and controllers that work together to create a comprehensive user experience. User's can create and edit accounts, log in, create and edit posts, follow/unfollow other users, and comment on individual posts. The site uses the carrierwave gem to allow user uploads to be used as avatars throughout the site.

						This is one of my first javascript apps that really puts an emphasis on functionality. It uses jQuery to dynamically add and remove items from a list. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To use the app, you simply type a task into the input box at the bottom and click submit. The new item is then appended to the end of the list and timestamped with the current time.
