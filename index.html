					This website was made for a prework assignment that asked us to create a basic website using HTML and CSS. The site features some of the basic CSS layout principles that we learned, including a floated image gallery and a basic three column layout. I tried to use a simple but still visually pleasing style.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why a website about dinosaurs? It's quite simple really. I was watching the original Jurassic Park for the hundreth time while I was starting to conceptualize the website and after getting lost in Jeff Goldblum's hazel eyes for awhile figured hey why not dinosaurs.

				<p>
					This is the first object oriented Javascript site that I made. It's a pretty straight forward webapp that lets you select and play songs from a preloaded playlist. It also gives the user the option to upload they're own songs if they'd like. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The site features a number of different option and controls, each with a corresponing function within the javasript file for increased functionality. This is also my first app that makes use of media queries and is responsive! Click the title to go to the site or right <a href="https://github.com/andrew-schultz/jukebox_js" class="spanlink">HERE</a> to go to the github repository.

				</h1>
				<p>
					This site was made for a homework assignment on the second day of class. The objective of the assignment was to build a basic website and to make git commits along the way at various points of development. The website features a clean design and makes use of floated div's and elements centered using the 'margin: 0 auto' trick.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why tree's and such? Sometime I get tired of all the concrete in the city and thought it would be nice to see some tree's. Also I wanted to throw a picture of my cat in there so that's where the 'such' comes in.

				</h1>
				<p>
					My first rails app. This was a collaborative project in which we were charged with creating an app that had the same basic functionality as webapps like Twitter and Tumbler. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The site features multiple models and controllers that work together to create a comprehensive user experience. User's can create and edit accounts, log in, create and edit posts, follow/unfollow other users, and comment on individual posts. The site uses the carrierwave gem to allow user uploads to be used as avatars throughout the site.

				</h1>
				<p>
					This was made for a prework assignment that wanted us to focus on using floats to create various layouts. The site features an image gallery, 2 column layout, and 3 column layout. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lot's have people have asked me "Andy, why on earth would you make a website about toilets?". Well you see, I started the hashtag on Instagram my junior year of college as a joke with some friends and it just hasn't died off all the way yet. Also, art or something like that.

				</h1>
				<p>
					This is one of my first javascript apps that really puts an emphasis on functionality.
				</p>
				<p>
					To use the app, you simply type a task into the input box at the bottom and click submit. The new item is then appended to the end of the list and timestamped with the current time.

				</h1>
				<p>
					This was a group project and also my first somewhat fleshed out website in sinatra.
				</p>
				<p>
					The site features multiple views that all work within a layout erb. I also included some jquery events to add some movement and points of interest to an otherwise static site.
